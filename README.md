## **Key Concepts Introduced:**
- **Three-stage architecture**: Sequential model chaining with intermediate features
- **Segmentation as features**: Using masks to enhance classification
- **Multi-channel inputs**: Combining RGB + mask channels
- **Feature fusion**: How intermediate representations improve final outputs
- **Pipeline complexity**: Managing data flow through multiple transformations

## **Part 1: Guided Example (25 minutes)**
- Complete working three-stage pipeline with detailed logging at each stage
- Shows **segmentation mask generation** and **mask-to-feature conversion**
- Demonstrates **channel concatenation** for enhanced classification
- Clear visualization of **intermediate outputs** at each pipeline stage

## **Part 2: Solo Exercise (25 minutes)**
- **25 structured TODOs** progressing from basic segmentation to advanced feature fusion
- **Multi-object scenarios** with varying segmentation complexities
- Focus on **practical implementation** of mask-enhanced classification
- **Performance comparison** between standard and mask-enhanced classification

## **Core Learning Objectives:**
1. **Multi-Stage Architecture**: Designing and implementing three-stage pipelines
2. **Segmentation Integration**: Using segmentation outputs as classification features
3. **Feature Fusion**: Combining RGB and mask information effectively
4. **Data Flow Management**: Handling complex transformations between stages
5. **Performance Analysis**: Understanding when additional stages improve results

This session builds directly on the two-stage foundation, adding segmentation as a **feature enhancement technique** rather than just an intermediate step. Students will understand how each pipeline stage can contribute information to improve final predictions.
